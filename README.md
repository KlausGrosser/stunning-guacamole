# Steps to create a local and remote repository, and how to link them afterwards:
* Create a new repo in GitHub
* Open the Terminal App and create a new folder. 
* Go to the new folder and clone the Github repo: `git clone <https> or <ssh>`
* Create a README file : `nano README.md`
* Â´Add text to the file. Then add the file and commit the sile, and finally push the file to upload it to the GitHub repo:
* `insert text` `^X` `git add-commit -m "instructions"` `git push`
* Go to Github and refresh the repo to see the new changes.
* Enjoy!
